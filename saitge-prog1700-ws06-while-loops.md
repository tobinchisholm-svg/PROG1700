## **2. Overview / Purpose / Objectives**

Loops make your programs dynamic and alive. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can automate repetition until something changes.
This session will help you **master the `while` loop** through creative, simple, and fun examples that get progressively harder.

By the end, you‚Äôll be able to:

* Build and control loops using conditions
* Avoid infinite loops through careful design
* Apply `break` and `continue` effectively
* Reflect on how repetition creates real-world functionality (games, counters, simulations)

---

## **3. Learning Outcomes Addressed**

* **O1:** Translate logic principles into programming code
* **O6:** Design and implement loops for repetition and control
* **O7:** Debug and test loops using IDE tools

---

## **4. Assignment Description / Use Case**

You will complete three creative mini-projects inside one Python file.
Each project introduces a basic loop pattern, and your task is to **improve it** with your own creative twist.

---

## **5. Tasks / Instructions**

### üßÆ **Step 1 ‚Äì The Counting Machine**

Start with this base program:

```python
# Simple counting machine
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Counting:", count)
    count += 1

print("Done counting!")
```

‚úÖ **Run it:** See how it counts from 1 to 5.
üí° **Now improve it:**

* Make it count **down** from 10 to 1.
* Print a cool message for each step (e.g., ‚ÄúLaunching in... 10 üöÄ‚Äù).
* Add `"Liftoff!"` at the end.

**Bonus:** Add a small `time.sleep(1)` delay between counts for dramatic effect.

---

### üéØ **Step 2 ‚Äì The Guessing Game 2.0**

Here‚Äôs your starter code:

```python
import random

secret = random.randint(1, 10)
guess = 0

while guess != secret:
    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))
    if guess < secret:
        print("Too low! üìâ")
    elif guess > secret:
        print("Too high! üìà")
    else:
        print("You got it! üéâ")
```

üí° **Challenge Upgrades:**

* Add a **guess counter** and stop after **5 tries**.
* Print `"Game Over üò¢"` if the player runs out of attempts.
* Award **points** (e.g., `score = 10 - attempts`) for guessing quickly.
* Add a **play again? (Y/N)** loop so players can restart.

**Hint:** Nesting loops is allowed‚Äîbut watch your indentation!

### üïπÔ∏è **Step 3 ‚Äì Creative Challenge: ‚ÄúLoop Your Own Adventure‚Äù**

Design your own fun simulation using a `while` loop.
Choose *one idea* below or invent your own.

**Ideas:**

1. **ü•§ Bubble Tea Simulator** ‚Äì Keep drinking sips until the cup is empty.

   ```python
   sips = 5
   while sips > 0:
       print("You take a sip... üßã")
       sips -= 1
   print("Cup empty. Refill time!")
   ```

   üí° Add: random ‚Äúboba pearl‚Äù encounters or ‚Äúbrain freeze‚Äù warnings.

2. **üêç Snake Growth Game** ‚Äì Print a growing line of snakes until size 10.

   ```python
   snake = ""
   while len(snake) < 10:
       snake += "üêç"
       print(snake)
   print("The snake is full size!")
   ```

3. **üé≤ Dice Battle** ‚Äì Simulate dice rolls between two players until one wins 3 rounds.

   ```python
   import random
   player1_score = 0
   player2_score = 0

   while player1_score < 3 and player2_score < 3:
       roll1 = random.randint(1,6)
       roll2 = random.randint(1,6)
       print(f"Player1:{roll1} | Player2:{roll2}")
       if roll1 > roll2:
           player1_score += 1
       elif roll2 > roll1:
           player2_score += 1
   print("Winner:", "Player 1" if player1_score > player2_score else "Player 2")
   ```

üí° **Customize:** Add emojis, power-ups, or sound effects (`print("\a")`).

## **6. Deliverables**

Submit **one** Python file named:
`studentnumber_PROG1700_ws09-01.py`
It must include:

1. All three exercises (Counting Machine, Guessing Game, Creative Challenge)
2. Your customized improvements and creative changes
3. Reflection answers in comments

---

## **7. Reflection Questions**

At the bottom of your file, answer in comments:

```python
# Reflection:
# 1. What bug or mistake caused your first infinite loop today?
# 2. How did you fix it?
# 3. Which loop activity did you enjoy most, and why?
# 4. How might while loops be useful in a game or app you‚Äôd build someday?
```
