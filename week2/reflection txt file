What happens when you forget to convert input to numbers?
itll give you an error, unless you are able to tell the user that they can only entire a number by programing it to say so. if u enter a number without the very simple valadtion itll just give you the error. doing this valadtion will allow the user to put in a vaild age for the program to run correctly.

whats the diffference between int () and float ()?
a float is used for very specific number with a decimal. an example of this is 3.25
a integer, int for short is a whole number. an example of this is 24

why do we validate input.
kinda answerd this in the first qustion, but it so that the user doesnt see an error. and can enter a vaild answer for the terminal.
