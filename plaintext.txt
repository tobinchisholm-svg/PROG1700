PROG1700 students will practice a Caesar cipher today.
Please read this file, choose a shift value, and encrypt the contents.
Then run the decryption routine to recover the original message.
This exercise demonstrates file I/O, simple text processing, and brute-force analysis.
Good luck and have fun!
