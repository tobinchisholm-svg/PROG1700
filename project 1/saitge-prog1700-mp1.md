## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This mini-project lets you **practice Weeks 1â€“4 skills**:

* Writing **pseudocode** and **flowcharts**.
* Translating logic into **Python code**.
* Handling **input, conditional logic, and console output**.
* Testing your program with **trace tables**.
* Reflecting on your **debugging and problem-solving process**.

You have **two options** for this assignment:

---

## **Option 1: Simple ATM Withdrawal Simulator**

**Problem Description:**

Create a program that:

1. Prompts the user for **current balance** and **withdrawal amount**.
2. Checks input validity:

   * Withdrawal > 0.
   * Withdrawal â‰¤ balance.
3. Displays **new balance** if valid, or **error messages** if invalid.

**Example:**

| Balance | Withdraw | Output                    |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| 500     | 200      | New balance: 300          |
| 500     | 600      | Error: Insufficient funds |
| 500     | -50      | Error: Invalid withdrawal |

---

## **Option 2: Your Own Logic Problem**

Choose a simple problem meaningful to you, such as:

* A **grading calculator**.
* A **budget checker**.
* A **temperature converter with warnings**.
* Any other problem that involves:

  * User input
  * Decision-making with **if/elif/else**
  * Displaying results

*(Ensure your chosen problem is small enough to complete)*

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Pseudocode / Flowchart (Deliverable #1)

* Write your solution as **pseudocode** or a **flowchart** before coding.
* Include all major decision points.
* Optionally, use a **free flowcharting tool** like [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Trace Table (Deliverable #2)

* Include at least **5 test cases**, covering:

  * Normal inputs
  * Edge cases
  * Invalid inputs

| Input(s) | Condition Checked | Output |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------ |
|          |                   |        |

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Python Implementation (Deliverable #3)

* Write a working Python program implementing your logic.
* Include comments explaining key parts of your code.
* Test all your trace table cases.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Optional Challenge

* Extend functionality:

  * For ATM: daily withdrawal limits, receipts, multiple withdrawals
  * For your own problem: additional rules, validations, or enhancements

---

## âœ… Deliverables

1. **Pseudocode / Flowchart**
2. **Completed Trace Table**
3. **Python Source Code**
4. **Optional:** Extended version of the program
5. **Reflection** (see below)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection (Deliverable #4)

Write **3â€“4 sentences**:

* What was the **most challenging part** of planning or coding?
* How did the **trace table** help identify errors before coding?
* How would you **explain your solution** to a friend new to programming?

---

## ðŸ“… Due Date

* Submit via LMS (Brightspace by Due Date) **by the end of Week 4**.

## âœ… Grading (10% of course grade)

| Criteria                                          | Marks  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Pseudocode / Flowchart                            | 2      |
| Program functionality (input, decision, output)   | 4      |
| Trace Table                                       | 1      |
| Reflection                                        | 1      |
| Code style, comments, testing, optional extension | 2      |
| **Total**                                         | **10** |
