# Reflection:
# 1. What is one real-world use of lists you can think of in your life or work?
#if you need to get groceries you can make a list of items you need to buy.

# 2. Which list operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) do you find easiest or hardest, and why?
# I find reading the easiest because it just involves accessing the list and displaying its contents.

# 3. How would you explain the concept of indexing to someone new to Python?
# Think of a list like a row of boxes. Each box has a number starting from 0, 
# If you want to get something from a box, you use its number â€” that number is the index."
