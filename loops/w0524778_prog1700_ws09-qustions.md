# Reflection:

# 1. What bug or mistake caused your first infinite loop today?
i accidently created a inginite loop by messing up the vaules guesses in part 2 of the workshop, and it woulednt even print the text i told it prin. and im not sure why but for a little while there was no right answer to the guessing game
# 2. How did you fix it?
i used ai to identify my problem, and i went back in anf fixed it up. 
# 3. Which loop activity did you enjoy most, and why?
i enjoyed ws-01 the most becasue i like to be right. and the other ones took me a while and i had to rely on ai once or twice to help guide me on what to do next. but for ws-01 i was able to fix and add onto very quickly and it worked first try  ðŸ˜Ž


# 4. How might while loops be useful in a game or app youâ€™d build someday?
You could use a loop in a game to handle health regeneration. After a player takes damage, a loop could slowly increase their health over time. If the player gets hit again, the loop would stop, and a timer would restart before healing begins again. Itâ€™s a smart way to make the game feel more realistic and responsive.
